# Insta-Scraper
# This code can scrape through public user profiles and get data such as followers, followings, count of posts.
# Also, it can collect the captions and hashtags of a specified number of posts which could be utilized for marketing purposes.

# I have used selenium for initializing and managing the browser and Beautiful Soup (a python library) to scrape through the web.
